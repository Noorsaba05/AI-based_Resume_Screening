📄 AI-Based Resume Screening SystemA Machine Learning powered tool that automates the candidate screening process. It ranks resumes based on their relevance to a Job Description (JD) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Vector Space Modeling.🚀 OverviewHR professionals often have to manually sift through hundreds of resumes for a single job opening. This system solves that problem by:Extracting text from PDF resumes.Cleaning and normalizing the text using NLP techniques.Mathematically calculating the similarity between the resume and the Job Description.Generating a ranked list of candidates with a "Match Percentage".🛠️ Tech StackFrontend: Streamlit (for the Web UI)NLP & Processing: * spaCy (for Lemmatization & Tokenization)pdfminer.six (for PDF Text Extraction)re (Regular Expressions for cleaning)Machine Learning: scikit-learn (TF-IDF Vectorization & Cosine Similarity)Data Handling: pandas✨ Key FeaturesPDF Parsing: Supports uploading multiple PDF resumes at once.Smart Cleaning: Removes emails, phone numbers, and URLs to focus purely on skills and experience.Skill Extraction: Automatically identifies technical skills (e.g., Python, SQL, Machine Learning) from the text.TF-IDF Ranking: Uses Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency to weigh rare, important keywords higher than common filler words.Visual Analysis: Displays a relevance score distribution chart.⚙️ Installation & SetupFollow these steps to run the project locally:Clone the Repositorygit clone [https://github.com/your-username/ai-resume-screener.git](https://github.com/your-username/ai-resume-screener.git)

🧠 How It Works (The Logic)Text Extraction: The system uses pdfminer to extract raw text from uploaded PDFs.Preprocessing: * Regex: Removes special characters, emails, and links.Lemmatization (SpaCy): Converts words to their root form (e.g., "Designing" -> "Design", "Ran" -> "Run") to ensure accurate matching.Vectorization (TF-IDF): * Converts the Job Description and Resumes into numerical vectors.Assigns weights to words based on uniqueness (e.g., "Python" gets a higher weight than "Team").Similarity Calculation: * Uses Cosine Similarity to measure the angle between the Job Description Vector and the Resume Vector.The closer the angle is to 0, the higher the match score (0-100%).🔮 Future ImprovementsContextual Understanding: Implementing Word Embeddings (Word2Vec/BERT) to understand synonyms (e.g., knowing that "ML" and "Machine Learning" are the same).Experience Scoring: Adding Entity Recognition to associate years of experience with specific skills.Category Classification: Automatically categorizing resumes into domains (Web, Data Science, DevOps).📂 Project Structure├── app.py              # Main Streamlit application
